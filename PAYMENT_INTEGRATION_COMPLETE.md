## 🧪 **TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE ADDED**

## 🚀 **TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Razorpay Enhancements:**
```javascript
// Simplified, working configuration
const options = {
  key: RAZORPAY_KEY_ID,
  amount: order.amount,
  currency: order.currency,
  name: 'ComplyGuard AI',
  description: `${plan.name} Plan - AI-Powered Compliance Platform`,
  order_id: order.id,
  prefill: { email: userEmail, name: userEmail.split('@')[0] },
  theme: { color: '#2563eb' },
  handler: (response) => onSuccess(response),
  modal: { ondismiss: () => onError({ reason: 'Payment cancelled' }) }
};
```

### **PayPal Enhancements:**
```javascript
// Simplified SDK loading
script.src = `https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=${PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID}&currency=USD&intent=capture`;

// Streamlined button configuration
paypal.Buttons({
  style: { layout: 'vertical', color: 'blue', shape: 'rect', height: 45 },
  createOrder: (data, actions) => actions.order.create({
    purchase_units: [{ amount: { currency_code: 'USD', value: amount.toFixed(2) } }]
  }),
  onApprove: async (data, actions) => {
    const orderDetails = await actions.order.capture();
    onSuccess({ orderID: data.orderID, details: orderDetails });
  }
});
```
